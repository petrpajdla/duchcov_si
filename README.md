SI contains data files and code necessary to generate most of the the plots used in the text of the article and a report with detailed approach to the analysis. All code is concentrated in an RMarkdown file generating the report (reports/duchcov_support.Rmd).

Part of the data (lead isotope compositions of different raw material sources used for comparisons) was gathered from various published and yet to be published works.
This data input is included in the form of references only and thus the analysis is not fully reproducible.
